## Module 5 - Query Formulation Guidelines

Module 4 introduces Basic Query Formulation with SQL, emphasizing the development of query formulation skills. Building on the foundational knowledge of the relational data model and the CREATE TABLE statement, this module covers the basic syntax of the SQL SELECT statement and the JOIN operator for combining tables. Examples illustrate single-table conditions, join operations, and grouping operations. Practice exercises involve writing simple SELECT statements using the tables created in Module 3 assignments. A concept quiz assesses comprehension of the video lessons and accompanying notes; completing this quiz before beginning the practice problems and graded assignment is recommended to ensure a solid understanding of the material.

### Learning Objectives

Articulate conceptual comprehension about databases, DBMSs, query formulation, and database development.

Demonstrate proficiency (knowledge and skills) of basic/intermediate query formulation by writing interpreting SQL statements, applying problem-solving guidelines, and using a DBMS client tool
