## Module 2 - Introduction to Databases and DBMSs

Module 2 introduces databases and DBMSs by examining how database technology influences organizations. Its content includes an overview of fundamental database characteristics, non-procedural access features, two key processing environments, and the evolution of the database software industry. This concise informational module ensures a shared background and context, laying the groundwork for success in later modules that emphasize detailed concepts and practical skills.

### Learning Objectives

Articulate conceptual comprehension about databases, DBMSs, query formulation, and database development

## Lessons and Assignments

### Databases and database technology vital to modern organizations

- Database technology supports daily operations and decision making
- Emphasize structured data
- Essential characteristics of shared, inter-related, and persistent
- How to define Database before using it

### Non-procedural access as crucial DBMS feature

- Query: request for data to answer a question
- Indicate what parts of database to retrieve not the procedural details
- Improve productivity and accessibility
- SQL SELECT statement and graphical tools
- Database retrieval using SQL and database client tool
- Database programming languages for big data tasks and customization of applications

### Transaction Processing Overview

- Collection of database operations processed as one unit of work
- Briefly explain key characteristics of database transactions
- Explain the word “transparency” for transaction processing services
- Reliable and efficient processing of transactions
    - Control concurrent users
    - Recover from failures
- Internal features for enterprise DBMSs
    - Concurrency control manager
    - Recovery manager

### Data Warehouse Characteristics

- Essential part of infrastructure for business intelligence
- Logically centralized repository for decision making
    - Populated from operational databases and external data sources
    - Integrated and transformed data
    - Optimized for reporting

### Comparison of Environments

- Transaction processing
    - Primary data in operational databases
    - Large volumes of transactions with relatively small amounts of data per transaction
    - Some reporting requirements for operations
- Business intelligence processing
    - Secondary data from operational databases
    - Substantial processing for transformations and integration
    - Large volumes of data for reporting
