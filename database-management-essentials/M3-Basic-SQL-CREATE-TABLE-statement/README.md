## Module 3 - Lesson 3: Basics of the SQL CREATE TABLE Statement

Module 3 addresses the Relational Data Model and the CREATE TABLE statement, building on the previously introduced context for database features and environments. This module introduces relational data model terminology, integrity rules, and the CREATE TABLE statement. Hands-on practice and graded assignments involve working with a chosen database management system (DBMS)â€”either the Oracle Cloud database server with the SQL Developer client or the PostgreSQL database server with the pgAdmin client. Tables are created using SQL and populated via provided INSERT statements. A concept quiz assesses comprehension of the video lessons and associated notes, and completing this quiz before starting the practice problems and graded assignment is recommended to ensure a solid understanding of the material.

### Learning Objectives

Demonstrate proficiency in creation of SQL databases by writing CREATE TABLE statements containing column definitions and constraints, interpreting Oracle database diagrams, explaining the representation of 1-M, M-N, and self-referencing relationships in an Oracle database diagram, and using a DBMS client tool to create and populate tables
